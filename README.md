# üåå Space Exploration Drone Control System

## üöÄ Overview
In the year 2127, the **High Command Control of the Universe and Planets** (HICCUP) governs interstellar exploration and drone fleets across planetary sectors.  
This project delivers a full system to **manage exploration drones**, **mine uranium**, **discover new planets**, and **teleport via hyperspace tunnels**.

HICCUP has established a **certification process** for software systems, ensuring quality and compliance. This system was developed following **Clean Code**, **SOLID principles**, and a **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** architecture.

## üß© Domain Entities

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Planet** | A planet that can be regular or a Space Station. It holds drones, uranium, neighbors, and hyperspace tunnels. |
| **ExplorationDrone** | An autonomous exploration drone that can move, mine, explore, and transport through tunnels. |
| **HyperspaceEnergyTunnel** | A unidirectional hyperspace tunnel connecting two planets for instant drone transport. |


---

## üìè Business Rules

- **Movement Constraints**:
    - Drones can move only north, south, east, or west if the neighboring planet exists.
    - Drones cannot pass sector borders or enter energy fields.

- **Mining Fairness**:
    - The drone with the least uranium load mines first.
    - Drones can mine as much uranium as their capacity allows.
    - Mining by the wrong drone throws a `ExplorationDroneControlException`.

- **Hyperspace Tunnels**:
    - Only one hyperspace tunnel per entry planet.
    - Entry and exit planets must be different.
    - Transport through tunnels is instantaneous and one-way.

- **Command History**:
    - Every executed command (even failed ones) is recorded in each drone‚Äôs history.
    - Drones have unique names for ASPCR compliance.

## üìö Development Principles

This project strictly follows:
- **Clean Code** principles for readability and maintainability.
- **SOLID** object-oriented design principles.
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** methodology.
- **Layered Architecture**: clear separation of domain, application, infrastructure, and interfaces.
